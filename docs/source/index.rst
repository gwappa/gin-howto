Gin HOWTO
==========

This page is to provide some basics and principles
for people who intend to start using Gin.

.. note::

   If you are completely new to the concepts such as "repositories" and "git",
   start reading from :doc:`repositories`, and then probably follow the order
   of the document.

   If you feel familiar to how to work with Git and GitHub, then first read
   :doc:`git` to grasp some notable differences between Gin and Git.
